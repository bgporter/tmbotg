## tmbotg - a twitter bot

A little project that randomly tweets out fragments of lyrics from They Might Be Giants 
songs.

### NOTE 

If you'd like to use this as the basis for a twitterbot of your own, please check out the related [Nanobot](https://github.com/bgporter/nanobot) framework that's extracted from this project and should make your work easier. 


### Colophon & Thanks

- Obviously, thanks to They Might Be Giants, both for writing this stuff in the first place, and (as importantly for this project) not being all cease-and-desisty to this kind of fan project. This project is not officially affiliated with the band.
- All the editors/contributors to 'TMBW: The They Might Be Giants Knowledge Base' (http://www.tmbw.net) for maintaining full lyrics in a format that was relatively easy for me to extract.

**Python modules**

- [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) is the only reasonable way to deal with HTTP in Python.
- Similarly, [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) needs to be your first choice when you need to parse HTML, even the most horrible HTML
- [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) for handling the Twitter API. Clean and sensible.

### GetLyrics.py

Utility using Requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape the lyrics database that's at http://tmbw.net, storing the lyrics as one file per track.

### tmbotg.py

Twitter bot app (written using Twython) that assumes it will be called once a minute by a cron job. Approximately once an hour (depending on configuration data), it should generate a new tweet.

I've also written a post on my work blog about this code that may be of interest:

**TODO:** 

- [ ] occasionally also use tweet contents to perform google image searches; include links in the tweet.
- [ ] add logging
- [ ] Add a mode that generates (daily?) stats (#posts, #followers, #favs, #retweets)
- [ ] wrap the update_status call in a try block so we can catch (and log) TwythonError exceptions (e.g. on a duplicate status update)
- [x] add the ability to process mentions that contain a '?' by replying to that user with a chunk of lyrics.
- [x] Favorite any post that mentions us.
- [x] Track the time of the most recent tweet & refuse to twwet again for some period of time after that (rate-limit to not feel spammy. Max once an hour? )
